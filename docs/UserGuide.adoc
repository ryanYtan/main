== About `Jarvis`

`Jarvis` is a one-stop solution to juggling all aspects of your hectic school life by helping you manage your
schoolwork, finances and CCAs. Offering four main features to bolster your
productivity, you can now always be on top of your:

[[link-main-features]]
1. **Tasks**
2. **Finances**
3. **Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)**
4. **NUS Courses**

all in one handy, nifty application. Our aim is to build an intuitive, user-friendly student life organiser
to, as far as possible, alleviate the stress of NUS life.
//Jarvis also supports undo and redo functionality, allowing you easily
//undo and redo any mistakes that you may make in your application.

== Let's get started

Please ensure you have https://www.java.com/en/download/[Java 11] or above installed
on your PC.

1. You can download the latest version of `Jarvis` https://www.google.com/[here].

2. Move `Jarvis` to the directory you would like to use as the
home folder for the application.

3. Run `jarvis.jar` to start the app. You should see the following on starting the application up:

.Jarvis' Graphical User Interface (GUI)

{sp} +

Jarvis' <<link-main-features, four main features>> have been split into four distinct tabs. You can
toggle between tabs by either clicking on the tabs themselves, pressing the `tab` key or by using the
features' `list` commands.

You can learn more about the each feature's individual GUI and its respective commands in the coming sections.

{sp} +

== Features

Before delving straight into each feature, here are some things to note - in order to get the most
out of this user guide.

:sectnums!:
=== Command Format

* Words in `UPPER CASE` are parameters supplied by the user, while those
in `lower case` are **commands** used in `Jarvis`.
+
For example:
+
`add-task t/TASK-TYPE des/TASK-DESCRIPTION`
+
In the above example, `TASK-TYPE` and `TASK-DESCRIPTION` are the parameters supplied by
the user, while `add-task` and the prefixes, `t/` and `des/`, are parts of a command.

* Items in square brackets `[]` are optional.
+
For example, the command:
+
`add-task t/TASK-TYPE des/TASK-DESCRIPTION [p/PRIORITY]`
+
Can be used:
+
With a priority level:: `add-task t/todo des/assignment p/high`
+
or
+
Without a priority level:: `add-task t/todo des/assignment`

* Parameters with `...` can be used once or more.
+
For example:
+
`[#TAG]...` is an optional parameter that can either not be used, used once,
or used multiple times.
+
Without an optional parameter:: `add-task t/todo des/assignment`
+
or
+
With an optional parameter:: `add-task t/todo des/assignment #cs2103t #urgent`

* Jarvis can parse parameters to commands in *any order*.

* Some commands can take in different parameters. These parameters are represented with a pipe, `|` ,
surrounded by curly braces, e.g `{param1 | param2}`.
+
For example, the command:
+
`export {csv | txt | xlsx} f/FILENAME`
+

can be used
+
With a csv parameter:: `export csv f/MyFile`
+
or
+
With a txt parameter:: `export txt f/MyFile`

* Dates follow the following format: `d/m/yyyy`.
+
For example:
+
`add-task t/deadline des/assignment d/1/1/1970`

=== Task Planner

A digital planner to help you stay organized; `Jarvis` can help you cope with your interminable lists of deadlines,
events, errands and more. Tagging and prioritizing tasks are just two of the many ways `Jarvis` will
enable you to stay on top of everything you need to do!

==== Adding a task: `add-task`
The most fundamental command for the Planner - `add-task` adds a task to the Planner.

[[link-attributes]]
A task *must* have a:

* `TASK-TYPE`: `todo`, `event` or `deadline`
* `TASK-DESCRIPTION`: a short description of the task
* `DATE` (for `Event` and `Deadline` tasks only)

A task *may* have the following *attributes*:

* `TAG`: any number of tags, such as `#school` or `#cca`
* `PRIORITY` level: `high`, `medium` or `low`
* `FREQ` frequency: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly` or `yearly`

You can refer to the table below for a brief overview of the different command formats for the
different types of tasks.

|===
| Task Type | Format

|`Todo`
|`add-task t/todo des/TASK-DESCRIPTION [#TAG]... [p/PRIORITY f/FREQ]`

|`Event`
|`add-task t/event des/TASK-DESCRIPTION d/START-DATE//END-DATE [#TAG]... [p/PRIORITY f/FREQ]`

|`Deadline`
|`add-task t/deadline des/TASK-DESCRIPTION d/DUE-DATE [#TAG]... [p/PRIORITY f/FREQ]`
|===

NOTE: Duplicate tasks are not allowed in the Planner!

===== Example
----
add-task t/event des/workshop f/weekly d/25/12/2019//26/12/2019
add-task t/deadline des/cs2101 assignment d/20/9/2019 p/high
----

And as simple as that, `Jarvis` can begin to keep track of
your tasks for you!

==== Deleting a task: `delete-task`
If you want to keep your list of tasks updated and current, you can easily delete tasks from the planner.

Format: `delete-task INDEX`

where `INDEX` is the **one-based** index of the task list.

===== Example
----
delete-task 3
----

==== Finding a task: `find-task`
Too many tasks to comb through? Ask `Jarvis` to find a task for you based on one or more keywords that match the
descriptions of your tasks.

Format: `find-task KEYWORD...`

NOTE: There must be at least one keyword & this command is case-insensitive.

===== Example
----
find-task assignment
find-task homework cs ma1101r
----

==== Updating a task's status: `done-task`
Once you have completed a task (hooray!), you can let `Jarvis` know. By default on
`add-task`, all tasks are marked as undone, represented by a `[✗]`. Upon marking the task as done, the task will be
represented with a `[✓]`.

Format: `done-task INDEX`

where `INDEX` is the **one-based** index of the task list.

==== Sorting tasks by attribute: `pull-task`
To get a quick glimpse of all the tasks you have in your Planner that match a certain <<link-attributes, attribute>>,
simply pull all tasks relating to that attribute.

Format: `pull-task { t/TYPE | #TAG | p/PRIORITY-LEVEL | f/FREQUENCY-LEVEL | d/DATE }`

===== Example
----
pull-task t/todo
pull-task #cs2106
----

NOTE: `pull-task` is different from `find-task` so as to make a clear distinction between looking for tasks
by task description only (`find-task`), and looking for tasks based on specific attributes (`pull-task`).


==== Listing all tasks: `list-task`
Lists all the tasks in the Planner. Using `list-task` while on another page of Jarvis will
pull up the Planner tab.

Format: `list-task`

==== Editing a task: `edit-task` [v2.0]
As you approach the deadlines for certain tasks, you might want to increase their priority levels. Soon, you will be able
to edit existing tasks instead of deleting and adding them back in again.

Format: `edit-task INDEX//NEW-DESCRIPTION...`

`NEW-DESCRIPTION` can be a new task description or any of the other <<link-attributes, attributes>>
used to create a task. You can also edit any number of attributes at the same time, each separated with a space.
However, only one instance of each attribute is allowed per command.

NOTE: `NEW-DESCRIPTION` must be tagged with the attribute prefix. For example, if you want to edit the task description
and priority level of a task: `edit-task INDEX//des/NEW-TASK-DESCRIPTION p/NEW-PRIORITY-LEVEL`.

===== Example
----
edit-task 1//des/project part 2
edit-task 2//des/project part 2 d/18/09/2019
edit-task 3//f/weekly
----

==== Clearing entries: `clear-task` [v2.0]
Soon you will also be able to delete multiple entries at one go. Tasks can be cleared by `#TAG` or `d/DATE` - where
tasks with the specified tag or date will be cleared.
The command `clear-task` with no parameters succeeding it will result in all tasks
being cleared.

Format: `clear-task [#TAG]... [d/DATE]`

===== Example
----
clear-task #school
clear-task d/12/09/2019
----

Finance Tracker Lookup

Feature by
-> Goh Si Ning
////
{sp} +

=== Finance Tracker
Introducing the Finance Tracker feature of Jarvis - responsible for keeping track of all your purchases,
monthly subscriptions and debts owed.

//todo: add a ui ss

On switching to the Finance tab, you will be able to see a list of purchases on
the left and a list of your monthly subscriptions on the right. On the bottom left, Jarvis will show the accumulative
spending for that month, as well as how much you are left with (if you have set a spending limit).

As students, we often fail to keep our spending habits in check. But do not worry, as with `Jarvis`, you will never
have to worry about not saving enough for that new laptop or yet another trip with your friends.

==== Add a single-use purchase: `add-paid`

Bought another cup of GongCha at UTown? Let `Jarvis` know.

Don't worry about remembering __when__ you made your purchase, as each purchase entered will automatically be set
to its date of entry! Jarvis will then update your monthly expenses accordingly, as well.

Format: `add-paid d/PURCHASE-DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT`

NOTE: Jarvis will show the latest purchase at the top of the list so you can easily see your last purchase without
scrolling!

===== Example
----
add-paid d/GongCha a/2.8
add-paid d/GongCha a/2.89
----

==== Delete a single-use purchase: `delete-paid`

If you have just returned something that you had bought online, `delete-paid` will remove the purchase at the specified
*one based* index on the list of purchases shown on the Finance tab. Jarvis will update your monthly expenses accordingly - meaning you have more to spend for the
rest of the month without exceeding your budget!

Format: `delete-paid INDEX`

NOTE: `INDEX` corresponds to *one based* index shown on the list __What I bought this month...__ under the Finance tab.
This also means that the index must exist within this list!

==== Searching for a purchase: `find-paid`
To have a quick view of the number of cups of Gongcha you have bought over the last month, you can used `find-paid`
to pull up purchases with descriptions matching `KEYWORD` provided.

Format: `find-paid KEYWORD`

===== Example
----
find-paid Gongcha
----

==== Add a monthly subscription: `add-install`
`Jarvis` also supports installments so that you do not need to key in your Netflix subscription fees each month.
Purchases entered with `add-install` will automatically be deducted from your budget at the same time every month.

Format: `add-install d/INSTALLMENT-DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT`

===== Example
----
add-install n/Phone bill a/43.0
add-install n/Spotify a/9.50
----

==== Delete a monthly subscription: `delete-install`
With finals approaching, you might have decided to remove all distractions to help you study better. Unfortunately,
this would also include your Netflix account.

Format: `delete-install INDEX`

Removing installments will also result in your monthly expenses being updated accordingly.

NOTE: `INDEX` corresponds to *one based* index shown on the list __What I spend on monthly...__ under the Finance tab. This also
means that the index must exist within this list!


==== Edit an installment: `edit-install`
If you have just changed your contract for your phone, let `Jarvis` know! You can easily reflect any changes
to your installments on the Finance Tracker through `edit-install`.

Format: `edit-install INDEX { d/INSTALLMENT-DESCRIPTION | a/AMOUNT | d/INSTALLMENT-DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT }`

===== Example
----
edit-install 1 a/10
edit-install 2 d/Spotify student plan
edit-install 2 d/Spotify student plan a/7.50
----

==== Setting a monthly spending limit: `set-limit`
Taking control of your spending might mean asking `Jarvis` to set a cap on your monthly budget.
//todo what happens when you exceed your budget

Format: `set-limit a/AMOUNT`

===== Example
----
set-limit a/300
set-limit a/500.90
----

==== Listing finances: `list-finances`
Lists all the purchases in the Finance Tracker. Using `list-task` while on another page of `Jarvis` will
pull up the Finance tab. If you have previously searched through your purchases for something, `list-finances`
will return the original list of purchases.

Format: `list-finances`

==== Exporting to File: `export` [v2.0]
Conveniently export your expenditures to either a txt, csv, or xlsx file..

Format: `export {csv | txt | xlsx} f/FILENAME`

===== Example
----
export csv f/expenditures
export txt f/MyFile
----

NOTE: Jarvis will export the file containing all expenditures to its current directory.

==== Adding owed amounts: `owe` & `debt` [v2.0]
A night out with friends usually ends in someone paying first and subsequently, splitting the tab with the rest of the
group. If you need an easy way of remembered who owes whom, let `Jarvis` take care of your debts.

`add-owe`: someone else paid the bill, and now you owe him/her.

`add-debt`: you paid the bill, and now people owe you.

Format:

`add-owe d/DESCRIPTION n/PERSON a/AMOUNT`

or

`add-debt d/DESCRIPTION n/PERSON a/AMOUNT`

===== Example
----
add-owe n/Jamie a/5.50
add-debt n/Sean a/10
----

==== Splitting a Tab: `add-tab` [v2.0]
You settled the bill first this time? Let `Jarvis` do the math!

Format: `add-tab d/DESCRIPTION a/TOTAL-AMOUNT n/PERSON...`

===== Example
----
add-tab d/pizza party a/20 n/Alice n/Bob n/Charlie
----

NOTE: The above example is equivalent to adding these commands separately: +
`add paid d/pizza party a/5` +
`add-debt n/Alice a/5` +
`add-debt n/Bob a/5` +
`add-debt n/Charlie a/5`


==== Mark a debt/owe as paid: `paid-debt` - [v2.0]
Updating settled debts can be easily done through `paid-debt`. Soon `Jarvis` will be able to mark your debts or owed
amounts as done.

`done-owe` should be used when someone has paid you back for money they have owed you.

`done-debt` should be used when you have paid someone back from money you owed them.

Format:

`done-debt INDEX`

or

`done-owe INDEX`

where `INDEX` corresponds to the *one based* index shown on the list of debts under the Finance tab. This also
means that the index must exist within this list!

===== Example
----
done-owe INDEX 1
done-debt INDEX 2
----

CCA tracker

Feature by
-> Tan Ye Kai
////
{sp} +

=== CCA tracker
The CCA tracker is a feature unique to `Jarvis`. Entirely customizable based on individual interest,
`Jarvis` can support milestone tracking, equipment management and so much more! Never has being in multiple
CCAs been so easy.

==== Adding a CCA: `add-cca`
To start, we can add some CCAs to the CCA Tracker. You will need to to specify
the name of the cca and the type of CCA.

Format: `add-cca n/NAME t/TYPE [e/EQUIPMENT]...`

The `types` of the CCA are:

* `performingArt`
* `sport`
* `club`
* `uniformedGroup`

===== Example
----
add-cca n/Swimming t/sport e/swimming trunks e/goggles
add-cca n/Canoeing t/sport
add-cca n/Guitar Ensemble t/performingArt e/guitar
----

==== Deleting a CCA: `delete-cca`
New semester, new CCAs - deleting outdated ones is a breeze.

Format: `delete-cca INDEX`

where `INDEX` is the *one-based* of a CCA.

===== Example
----
delete-cca 1
----

==== Editing a CCA: `edit-cca`
If you have bought some new running shoes, or the latest tuner for your violin, let `Jarvis`
know so that your changes to your CCAs can be updated!

Format: `edit-cca INDEX { n/NAME | t/TYPE | e/EQUIPMENT...}`

===== Example
----
edit-cca 1 t/sport e/tennis racket
edit-cca 1 t/performingArt
edit-cca 1 n/Running e/shoes e/water bottle
----

[NOTE]
`Jarvis` will soon also be able to edit the milestones of your CCAs in v2.0!

==== Listing a CCA: `list-cca`
Lists all your CCAs in the CCA Tracker. Using `list-cca` while on another page of Jarvis will
pull up the CCA Tracker tab.

Format: `list-cca`


==== Finding a CCA: `find-cca`
For a quick view of CCAs matching one or more keywords, `find-cca` will come in useful.

Format: `find-cca KEYWORD...`

===== Example
----
find-cca swimming
find-cca canoeing guitar
----

==== Adding progress levels for a CCA: `add-progress`
Often, we strive to reach certain milestones in our CCAs. For example, in swimming, you might be aiming to
progress through the various grade levels (shown in the example below) available. With `add-progress`,
`Jarvis` can help you set and keep track of your progress towards each milestone in each of your CCAs.

Format: `add-progress INDEX p/MILESTONE... `

===== Example
----
add-progress 1 p/bronze p/silver p/gold p/gold star
add-progress 2 p/Beginner boat p/Intermediate boat p/Racing boat
add-progress n/Guitar Ensemble l/8
----

==== Incrementing progress level: `increment-progress`
Each time you have made progress towards any of your milestones, let `Jarvis` know! The progress bar for each CCA
provides a clear view of how much closer you are to their respective milestones.

Format: `increment-progress INDEX`

[NOTE]
Note that progress can only be incremented if `add-progress` has previously been executed on that particular CCA.

===== Example
----
increment-progress 1
----

Course Planner

Feature by
-> Ryan Tan Yu
////

{sp} +

=== Course Planner
NUSMods serves as a complete knowledge bank of all modules in NUS. We often use it to plan our timetables,
map out academic routes and learn more about the variety of courses NUS has to offer.
As the Course Planner section of `Jarvis` is thoroughly integrated with NUSMods, you will be able to consolidate all
the courses you have taken in NUS to date, as well as figure out what courses you could possibly take in the future.

==== Adding a course: `add-course`
To get started, you can add specific course(s) to your list. You may add one or more courses at one go.

Format: `add-course c/COURSE-CODE...`

where `COURSE-CODE` is the course code of the {nusmods-modules}[NUS course] you
want to add.

===== Example
----
add-course c/CS1010
add-course c/CS1010 c/CS2030 c/CS2040
----

==== Adding a course with grades: `add-course` [v2.0]
You can also add courses with grades. This is how `Jarvis` can tell you
your current CAP. The grade can be any valid NUS grade.

Format: `add-course c/COURSE-CODE g/GRADE`

Example
----
add-course c/CS1010 g/A+
add-course c/MA1521 g/B+
add-course c/CS1231 g/B
----

==== Deleting a course: `delete-course`
You can easily delete a course from your list - either by the index of the course in the list,
or by its course code.

Format: `delete-course {c/COURSECODE | INDEX}`

===== Example
----
delete-course c/CS1010
delete-course 2
----

==== Looking up a course's information: `lookup`
You can also retrieve information about a specific course - such as name, course code,
number of credits and its prerequisites.

Format: `lookup c/COURSECODE`

===== Example
----
lookup c/CS1010
----

==== Checking a course: `check`
If you are not sure if you can take a certain course next semester, this command would come in handy. Simply `check`
the course in question.The result is dependent on the courses you have added to your list. `Jarvis` will
display a very helpful tree to show you what requirements you need for each course.

Format: `check c/COURSECODE`

===== Example
----
check c/CS1010
----

==== Showing Course Help: `help-course`
Currently specific to students from the School of Computing. You can view all
NUS Bachelor of Science (Computing) undergraduate requirements. This is data
taken directly from the School of Computing website, arranged within `Jarvis`
for your convenience

Format: `help-course`

==== Listing all courses: `list-course`
List all your courses in the Course Planner. If you do this while on another
page, `Jarvis` will automagically pull up the Course Planner

Format: `list-course`

==== Checking your CAP: [v2.0]
If you want to check your CAP (Cumulative Average Point), `Jarvis` can tell
you via the the `cap` command! This will depend on the grades input for
any course you have added. If a course in your list has no grades, `Jarvis`
will assume that you have not taken it.

Format: `cap`

Undo/Redo

Feature by
-> Marc Fong Yung Kit
////
{sp} +

=== App History

_"Oops! I have entered a command that has entered inaccurate information to the
application, and I am not sure where to find the mistake or how to fix it!"_

It's great that `Jarvis` remembers your changes and allows you to easily `undo` your
commands!

_"Wait! What if I am not sure if I want to undo the changes made by the
command?"_

`Jarvis` also enables you to `redo` any changes that you have undone! Therefore, you
can confidently `undo` and `redo` changes that you have made without worrying about
the inconvenience of remembering and re-entering commands all over again.

[NOTE]
Only commands that make changes to the content of JARVIS can be undone and redone. Commands that
list items or finds items in `Jarvis` therefore cannot be undone or redone.

`Jarvis` remembers the last thousand commands that you have entered into the
application, even after you exit the application!

`Jarvis` also lets you undo and redo multiple commands in a single undo or redo
command! This means that you can undo and redo up to a thousand commands with
a single undo or redo command.

[NOTE]
JARVIS undo and redo commands in a specific sequence:
 +
 +
Undo commands will undo command(s) starting from the latest command the user entered.
 +
 +
Redo commands will redo command(s) starting from the latest command that was undone.

If you are not sure of how many commands you have undone or redone, do not worry!
Jarvis can tell you how many commands you have undone or redone before you make any
further changes!

You can see how to undo and redo commands in JARVIS in the following
sections below, which will cover two new commands:

* `undo [NUMBER]`
* `redo [NUMBER]`
* `list-history`

[NOTE]
`[NUMBER]` is an optional argument indicating the number of commands that you
want to undo/redo.
 +
 +
`[NUMBER]` should be a positive integer that is not larger than
the available number of commands that can be undone/redone (Don't worry, JARVIS
will let you know if `[NUMBER]` is out of range).
 +
 +
If `[NUMBER]` parameter is not
supplied, then `[NUMBER]` is taken to be the value *1*.

==== undo command(s): `undo`
Format: `undo [NUMBER]`

where `[NUMBER]` is an optional argument indicating the number of commands that you
want to `undo`.

[NOTE]
`[NUMBER]` should be a positive integer, no larger than
the available number of commands that can be undone. (Don't worry, JARVIS
will let you know if `[NUMBER]` is out of range).
 +
 +
If `[NUMBER]` is not
supplied, then it is taken to be the default value of *1*.

===== Example

* `undo` -- This command will undo the latest command entered by the user.
It is equivalent to the command `undo 1`
* `undo 5` -- This command will undo the 5 latest commands entered by the user,
starting from the latest command.

==== redo command(s): `redo`
Format: `redo [NUMBER]`

where `[NUMBER]` is an optional argument indicating the number of commands that you
want to `redo`.

[NOTE]
`[NUMBER]` should be a positive integer, no larger than
the available number of commands that can be undone. (Don't worry, JARVIS
will let you know if `[NUMBER]` is out of range).
 +
 +
If `[NUMBER]` is not
supplied, then it is taken to be the default value of *1*.

===== Example

`redo` -- This command will redo the latest command undone by the user.
It is equivalent to the command `redo 1`

`redo 5` -- This command will redo the 5 latest commands undone by the user,
starting from the latest command that was undone.

[NOTE]
If you have entered new commands after undoing previous commands, you will not be able to redo the old
commands.

==== list the number of commands you can undo or redo: `list-history`
Format: `list-history`

Lists the number of available commands to be undone, number of available commands to be redone,
and the limit of the maximum number of commands Jarvis can remember for you to support undo and
redo commands.
